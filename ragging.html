            <div class="card">
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    As a student, I have directly experienced the pervasive fear and apprehension caused by ragging. This personal encounter ignited a deep passion to dismantle this harmful culture within educational institutions, ensuring new students can thrive in a safe and nurturing environment. My advocacy is rooted in a belief that kindness, respect, and collaborative leadership can effectively replace intimidation and hierarchy.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    The scale of this issue is staggering. Over the past 14 years, nearly **10,000 cases of ragging have been reported** on India's centralized anti-ragging portal. More alarmingly, between April 2022 and 2025 alone, **51 ragging-related deaths** have occurred, almost matching student suicides in major coaching hubs. Medical colleges, despite their smaller student populations, disproportionately account for a high percentage of these incidents and fatalities, reporting up to **30 times more ragging cases** relative to student numbers compared to other institutes.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    My practical approach to this issue was exemplified during our college's Tech Fest, where I led a team of over 50 student volunteers. I consciously adopted a guidance-based, non-dictatorial leadership style, demonstrating that even under intense pressure, significant achievements are possible through empathy and collective effort. This experience served as a tangible precedent, proving that a culture of mutual respect and compassion can effectively counter traditional power dynamics. Through consistent personal example and active discussions with peers, I strive to cultivate an atmosphere where every student feels welcomed and secure, contributing to a significant reduction in fear and an increase in positive peer interactions.

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    My vision extends beyond simply preventing incidents; it's about fostering a fundamental cultural shift where empathy and dignity are paramount. The persistence of ragging is a symptom of outdated power structures and a lack of understanding regarding its profound psychological and physical impact. My unique contribution lies in proving, through direct action, that true leadership empowers and uplifts, rather than intimidates. I am dedicated to championing environments where students feel safe to express themselves, innovate, and contribute without fear of harassment. This involves continuous advocacy, leading by example, and inspiring others to embrace a more compassionate and collaborative approach to community building within educational settings.
